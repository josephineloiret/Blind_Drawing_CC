# Blind Drawing

Blind Drawing is an interactive web application that challenges you to create art without seeing your canvas in real-time. Draw freely with various brush types including pencil, pen, watercolor, and paintbrush, then reveal your creation when you're ready. The app features a selection mode that lets you peek at specific areas of your drawing, encouraging experimentation and embracing the unexpected in your artistic process.

## How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The application uses p5.js which is loaded from a CDN, so no additional setup or installation is required.

## File Overview

- **index.html**: Sets up the HTML structure, styling, and loads the p5.js library and drawing script.
- **draw.js**: Contains all the drawing logic including brush types, color picker, canvas rendering, and user interface controls for the blind drawing experience.
