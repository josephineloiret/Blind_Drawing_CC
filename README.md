# Blind Drawing

A computational creativity project that explores how limiting visual feedback during the creative process can enhance artistic expression and embrace unexpected outcomes. By hiding the canvas while you draw, this tool frees you from self-judgment and perfectionism, allowing mistakes to become features rather than flaws. When you finally reveal your creation, you discover something entirely new—shaped by intuition and trust rather than visual control.

## How to Run

1. Open `screen.html` in any modern web browser
2. Start drawing with your mouse
3. Use the UI controls to adjust colors, brush types, and reveal your artwork

## Files

**screen.html** — The main HTML file that sets up the canvas container and loads the p5.js library and drawing application.

**draw.js** — Contains all the drawing logic, UI controls, brush rendering algorithms (pencil, pen, watercolor, paintbrush), color picker, selection mode, and canvas reveal functionality.
